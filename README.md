# Real-time Story
The code is live at https://timvdeijnden.github.io/story-vue/

## Using Vue.js & Firebase.

I've created this experiment in 2014 to create the same app using different frameworks. Back then I've created it in
- Vue.js
- Ember.Js
- Backbone.js
- Angular

And Firebase real-time database, which was the only Firebase product back then. It used version 1.0.10 of the Firebase dependency. The database was open for everyone to read and write.
Also bower was used to manage dependencies.

## Current version

I've updated the code to make it work again, it now also uses the Firebase Cloud functions to save the data which is more secure since writing is limited now. It still uses the old Vue code & and old Bootstrap.

To be specific:
 - Vue.js v0.9.3 (2014)
 - Bootstrap v3.0.3 (2013)
 - Firebase: (7.2.2)
     - Real-time Database
     - Cloud functions
